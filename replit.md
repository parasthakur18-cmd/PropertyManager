## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The UI uses shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI primitives, featuring a custom mountain-themed color palette, light/dark modes, and mobile-first responsiveness. Premium landing and login pages include animated gradients. Mobile optimization provides responsive room calendar columns and stacked tab layouts.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend uses React 18, TypeScript (Vite), Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state, and React Hook Form with Zod for validation. The backend is Express.js on Node.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design. PostgreSQL via Neon serverless is the primary database, accessed with Drizzle ORM. Authentication uses Replit Auth with OpenID Connect (OIDC) via Passport.js and session-based, secure HTTP-only cookies.
