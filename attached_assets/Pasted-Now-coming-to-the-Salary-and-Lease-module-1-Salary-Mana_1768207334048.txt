Now coming to the Salary and Lease module.

1. Salary Management (Carry Forward System)

Salary auto-marking is already implemented, which is good. However, we need a proper carry-forward mechanism for pending salary.

Example:

Monthly salary: ₹20,000

December:

Paid: ₹15,000

Pending: ₹5,000

January salary: ₹20,000

Total payable in January = ₹25,000 (₹20,000 + ₹5,000 pending)

Required behavior:

Pending salary should automatically carry forward to the next month

The payable amount should be recalculated automatically

2. Salary Breakup, Advances & Extra Advance Tracking

There should be a detailed salary breakup view that clearly shows:

Monthly salary

Previous pending amount

Payments made

Regular advances

Extra advances (clearly marked as “Extra Advance”)

Remaining balance

If any extra advance is given, it should be separately visible and adjustable in future salary calculations.

3. Attendance Impact (Absent / Leave Issue)

Currently, the Absent and Leave functionality is not working properly.

Expected behavior:

When a staff member is marked:

Absent → salary should be deducted automatically

Leave / Half-day → salary should adjust as per rules

These changes should reflect correctly in the salary calculation

Admin should be able to define:

Per-day salary calculation

Leave deduction rules

4. Lease Management (Carry Forward & Automation)

Lease payments should also follow a carry-forward system similar to salary.

Required features:

Track lease payments made to the property owner

Pending lease amounts from previous months or years should carry forward automatically

Lease setup should include:

Start date

End date

Lease duration (number of years)

Yearly increment (percentage or fixed amount)

The system should auto-calculate lease value every year based on the increment.

5. Lease Edit, Override & History

Admin should be able to:

Edit or update lease terms

Override auto-calculated values when required

All edits should be logged

6. Lease Payment Summary & Downloadable Ledger

There should be a complete lease payment summary, including:

Total lease amount

Payments made

Pending balance

Payment dates and number of payments

Admin should be able to:

View a ledger-style report

Download the ledger (PDF / Excel)

Expected Outcome

Accurate salary calculation with carry-forward

Clear tracking of advances and extra advances

Proper attendance-based salary deductions

Automated and flexible lease management

Full transparency with downloadable ledgers

Please review and implement the above improvements.
