Build an Airbnb-Style Room Availability Calendar System

I want you to build a complete Airbnb-style room availability checker for my PMS.
Follow these exact requirements:

1. Calendar UI (like Airbnb host calendar)

Create a horizontal date grid and vertical room list, like this:

             20  21  22  23  24  25  26
Room 101     █ █ █ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
Room 102     ▢ ▢ █ █ ▢ ▢ ▢
Room 103     ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢


Symbols:

█ (red) = booked

▢ (green) = available

Calendar must:

Scroll horizontally for dates

Scroll vertically for rooms

Fit mobile & desktop

Highlight selected date range

2. Date Range Search Function

Add a section above the calendar:

Check-in date

Check-out date

Guests (optional)

“Search Availability” button

When dates are selected, highlight available rooms across the grid.

3. Accurate Room Availability Logic

Use a date-block system like Airbnb:

For each booking, store:

room_id

check_in

check_out

status

Then generate blocked dates for each day:

Example booking:
Check-in: 2024-11-20
Check-out: 2024-11-23
Block dates: 20, 21, 22

Check-out day becomes available.

This prevents:

Overlapping bookings

Rooms staying blocked after cancellation

Rooms showing unavailable for future dates

4. Real-Time Availability Result

After user selects 20 to 25:

Show only the rooms that have all days free.

Example result:

Room 101 → Available

Room 102 → Not available

Room 103 → Available

Show these rooms as selectable cards below the calendar.

5. Group Booking Support

If the user wants 3 rooms, the system must:

Show only rooms available for all selected dates

Allow selecting multiple rooms (checkbox style)

Show selected rooms count

Show total price for entire stay

6. Dormitory Support (bed-level availability)

Add support for a dorm:

Dorm 6-Bed: [ ○ ○ ● ○ ○ ○ ]


Symbols:

○ green → available bed

● red → booked bed

Booking 1 bed should only block that bed, not the entire dorm.

7. Booking Actions

When user selects rooms, show a summary panel:

Booking Summary

Dates

Nights

Rooms selected

Total price

Advance amount

Buttons: “Create Booking” & “Create Enquiry”

8. Automatic Update on Cancellation

When booking is cancelled:

Remove date blocks

Refresh calendar

Room becomes available again

This solves the issue of rooms staying blocked after cancellation.
