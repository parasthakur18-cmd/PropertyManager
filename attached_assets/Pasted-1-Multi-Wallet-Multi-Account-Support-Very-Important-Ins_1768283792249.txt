1. Multi-Wallet / Multi-Account Support (Very Important)

Instead of only one cash + one bank, allow:

Multiple bank accounts (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, etc.)

Separate wallets:

Cash Counter

UPI (GPay / PhonePe / Paytm)

Online OTA settlements

Why this helps

Matches real-life hotel operations

Easier reconciliation

Clear audit trail

2. Auto-Split Revenue by Payment Mode

When a payment is received:

Select payment mode (Cash / UPI / Bank / Card / OTA)

Amount should auto-credit the correct wallet

Example:

₹3,000 room booking

₹1,000 Cash

₹2,000 UPI
→ Cash balance +₹1,000
→ Bank/UPI balance +₹2,000

3. Revenue vs Receivable vs Collected (Clarity Layer)

Add three clear numbers on the dashboard:

Total Revenue (earned today)

Collected Amount (cash/bank actually received)

Pending Receivable (to be collected later)

This avoids confusion when:

Partial payments

Pay-at-checkout bookings

OTA settlements

4. Daily Closing & Carry Forward (Hotel Style)

Add a “Day Closing” feature:

At end of the day:

Admin clicks Close Day

System locks today’s numbers

Carries forward:

Cash balance

Bank balance

Pending receivables

Next day opens with exact closing balance of previous day.

This is a BIG trust & control feature.

5. Expense Entry at Source (Real-Time P&L)

While adding expenses:

Tag expense as:

Food cost

Salary

Vendor payment

Maintenance

Miscellaneous

Select payment mode (cash/bank)

This way:

Expense instantly reduces balance

P&L updates in real time

No manual reconciliation later

6. Property-Wise & Date-Wise View

Allow filters:

Property-wise revenue & balance

Date-wise (Today / Yesterday / Custom range)

Shift-wise (Morning / Evening – optional)

Useful when you manage multiple properties (your case).

7. Alerts & Mismatch Warnings

Smart alerts like:

Cash received ≠ bills generated

Day not closed

Negative balance warning

High cancellation impact on revenue

This prevents leakage.

8. Downloadable Reports (Owner-Level)

Allow download of:

Daily Summary Report

Cash Book

Bank Book

Revenue Breakup (Room / Food / Add-ons)

Monthly P&L snapshot

PDF + Excel both.
