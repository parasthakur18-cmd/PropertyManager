Build a Task Manager module inside the PMS that supports task creation, assignment, tracking, reminders, WhatsApp notifications, custom mobile numbers, and in-app notifications. This system must work across multiple properties and roles (Admin / Owner / Staff).

1. Task Creation & Assignment

Allow Admin/Owner to create tasks for any property.

Each task must have the following fields:

Task Title

Task Description

Property (linked to PMS properties)

Assigned Staff/User

Due Date

Due Time

Task Priority (Low / Medium / High)

Task Status (default: Pending)

2. WhatsApp Reminder Recipient Setup (IMPORTANT)

While creating or editing a task, provide a section called “WhatsApp Reminder Recipients” with the ability to:

Add one or multiple mobile numbers

Default selectable options:

Assigned staff mobile number (auto-filled if available)

Admin / Owner mobile number

Allow manual entry of any WhatsApp-enabled mobile number

Validate numbers with country code

👉 This ensures reminders are not limited to admin only and can be sent to anyone responsible.

3. Task Status Management

Each task must support the following statuses:

Pending

In Progress

Completed

Rules:

Assigned users can update task status.

When a task is marked Completed:

All WhatsApp reminders must stop automatically

All in-app notifications must stop

Save task completion date & time

Move task to “Completed Tasks” list

4. Automatic Daily WhatsApp Reminders

If a task remains Pending or In Progress:

Send a daily WhatsApp reminder

Recipients:

Assigned staff

Admin / Owner

All added custom mobile numbers

Each reminder message must include:

Task name

Property name

Due date & time

Current task status

If the due date/time has passed:

Mark task as Overdue

Show “Overdue” label in dashboard and notifications

5. Custom Reminder Scheduling

While creating or editing a task, allow:

Enable / Disable reminders

Set custom reminder date & time

Reminder type:

One-time reminder

Daily reminder (repeat until task is completed)

6. Admin / Owner Daily Alert (10:00 AM Rule)

System must run a daily check at 10:00 AM:

If any task is still Pending or In Progress:

Send a WhatsApp alert to:

Admin / Owner

Any additional selected mobile numbers

Message must clearly state:

Task name

Assigned person

Due date & time

Status (Pending / Overdue)

7. In-App Notifications

Every WhatsApp reminder must also generate:

PMS notification bell alert

Real-time dashboard notification

Clicking the notification should:

Open a task details popup

NOT redirect to a new page

8. Task Dashboard View

Create a Task Dashboard with separate views:

All Tasks

Pending Tasks

Overdue Tasks

Completed Tasks

Filters required:

Property

Assigned user

Due date

Task status

Priority

9. System Behavior (Backend Logic)

Implement a Reminder Engine (Cron Job) that:

Runs automatically at defined intervals

Checks task status and reminder settings

Sends WhatsApp messages and in-app notifications

Stops reminders immediately when task is completed

Store reminder logs with:

Task ID

Mobile number

Date & time sent

Delivery status
