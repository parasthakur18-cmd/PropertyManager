There are still several issues and missing features in the app that need to be addressed.

1. User Creation & Role Assignment

Currently, when someone logs in through hostezee.in, the system creates a new, separate user account. This behavior is correct for new property owners.

However, there is no proper mechanism for property owners to add staff users and assign roles.

Expected flow:

Inside Admin Account → Settings → Users, there should be an option to Add User

Admin enters:

User email ID

Role (Admin / Manager / Staff or custom)

User receives an email invitation and logs in with assigned access

At present, all new login requests go to the Super Admin, which is fine for new property owners but incorrect for staff users.

2. Missing User Management Controls

There is no option to delete a user

There is no option to deactivate / suspend a user

Admin should be able to temporarily disable access without deleting the user

Services and system access for a user should be held or resumed anytime

3. Role-Based Access Control (Very Important)

Currently, there is no option to manually define permissions for a user.

For example:

If I want to give a Manager access only to bookings

Or allow access to calendar but not billing

Or allow food orders but not reports

This is not possible at the moment.

Required feature:

A permission-based system where Admin can:

Assign predefined roles, or

Manually enable/disable rights for each user

Example permissions:

View / Edit Bookings

Manage Calendar

Room Management

Food Orders

Payments & Billing

Reports

Settings Access

4. Centralized Settings Area

All these controls should be available only under the Settings section, for easy access and management:

Settings →

Users

Roles & Permissions

Add / Edit / Delete / Deactivate Users

Custom Permission Management

This will allow Admins to easily control user access without Super Admin dependency.

5. Login vs Signup on Website

Website should clearly show:

Login – for existing users

Sign Up – for new customers / property owners

This will avoid confusion and unnecessary Super Admin approval requests

Expected Outcome

Property owners can manage staff independently

Super Admin approval required only for new property owners

Admin can fully control user access and permissions

Cleaner, scalable, and more secure system

Please review and implement the above changes.
